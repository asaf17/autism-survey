                        Some questions are framed negatively and some positively. When a question refers to a child’s
                        “difficulties” this could refer to a specific developmental problem (if present), a set of symptoms or
                        behavioral issues, or simply to everyday life hassles and problems. Please read all questions
                        carefully before responding to be sure you are answering the question accurately.
